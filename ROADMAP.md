**Tasks**:
- Build NEW React/Next.js interface from scratch in apps/ directory
- Implement chat interface with Alice orchestrator API integration (port 8001)
- Real-time streaming responses via WebSocket
- Mobile-responsive design with PWA support
- Chat history, settings, and preference management
- **Target**: Functional web interface enabling chat with Alice

#### **1.2 Voice Pipeline Reactivation** 🎙️ **HIGH PRIORITY**
**Current Issue**: STT/TTS service in restart loop (Port 8002)
**Why Critical**: Natural voice interaction is essential for AI assistant adoption

**Tasks**:
- Debug voice service restart loop and port conflicts
- Validate Swedish TTS/STT model quality and performance  
- Test full voice conversation flow with Alice
- Optimize audio latency and quality
- **Target**: <2s TTS latency, >90% Swedish accuracy


#### **1.3 Ollama Service Debugging** 🔧 ✅ **RESOLVED**
**Status**: Fixed and operational (qwen2.5:3b) on port 11434
**Outcome**: Local LLM fallback working for privacy and offline capability

**Completed**:
- ✅ Fixed model health check failures and connection issues
- ✅ Validated orchestrator → ollama → response pipeline
- ✅ Tested full offline functionality and fallback logic
- ✅ **Achieved**: 100% health checks, <1s response time
